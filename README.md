## 🧐 What I have learnt from this project

It was my first project after learning a bit of HTML5 and CSS3 so I applied all the knowledge I had so far integrating a bit of Vanilla Javascript.

Initially it was hard to give it a real structure but then I applied flexboxes that really helped...I love flexboxes!!

I also did some research on how Museum webistes are laid out, so in my project I used colors that are similar to Vincent Van Gogh color palette and I tried to highlight his artwork by dedicating a section just for images.

I also learnt the concept of responsiveness and tried to apply it to this project...so much fun!
